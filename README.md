# TimeSeries

Implementing Time Series classification using deep learning models like
fully connected networks, bidirectional RNN, 1D-CNN, CNN + RNN,
CNNClassifier, MLP (Multilayer Perceptron), Fully convolutional networks, Rocket
and optimizing the best model on both univariate and multivariate
datasets.
